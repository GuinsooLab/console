/**
 * General interface for all critical file system operations required to read and write the
 * [[DeltaLog]]. The correctness of the [[DeltaLog]] is predicated on the atomicity and
 * durability guarantees of the implementation of this interface. Specifically,
 *
 * 1. Atomic visibility of files: Any file written through this store must
 *    be made visible atomically. In other words, this should not generate partial files.
 *
 * 2. Mutual exclusion: Only one writer must be able to create (or rename) a file at the final
 *    destination.
 *
 * 3. Consistent listing: Once a file has been written in a directory, all future listings for
 *    that directory must return that file.
