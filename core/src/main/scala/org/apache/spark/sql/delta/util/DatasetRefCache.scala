/**
 * A [[Dataset]] reference cache to automatically create new [[Dataset]] objects when the active
 * [[SparkSession]] changes. This is useful when sharing objects holding [[Dataset]] references
 * cross multiple sessions. Without this, using a [[Dataset]] that holds a stale session may change
 * the active session and cause multiple issues (e.g., if we switch to a stale session coming from a
 * notebook that has been detached, we may not be able to use built-in functions because those are
 * cleaned up).
 *
 * The `creator` function will be called to create a new [[Dataset]] object when the old one has a
 * different session than the current active session.
 *
 * Unlike [[StateCache]], this class only caches the [[Dataset]] reference and doesn't cache the
 * underlying `RDD`.
 *
 * @param creator a function to create [[Dataset]].
